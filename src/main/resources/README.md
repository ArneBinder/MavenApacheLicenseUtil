#Maven Apache License Util

If you want to publish your project under the [Apache2 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and it 
includes third-party libraries you have to fulfill their re-publishing requirements. This tool follows 
[this recommendation](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/234511/what-is-the-best-practice-for-arranging-third-party-library-licenses-paperwork) 
and helps you to create LICENSE-3RD-PARTY files. 

[These PAQs](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html) give an overview about licenses which are compatible with the Apache2 license.

##The workflow is as follows:

1. Update local repositories, build effective-poms and add pom content to `<license.stub.tsv>` for all projects, 
which are direct subfolders of `<superDirectory>`, by executing:
	- `maven-apache-license-util --updateTsvWithProjectsInFolder <superDirectory> <license.stub.tsv> <currentReleaseVersion>`
	
	`<currentReleaseVersion>` should be a value, which marks your current release.
	If you have an `<licenses.enhanced.tsv>` from an earlier release, use this as `<license.stub.tsv>`. 
	The former license information will be kept, just the old `<currentReleaseVersion>` value will be overwritten, 
	if the library is still in use for the current release.

	NOTE: This will overwrite the old `<licenses.enhanced.tsv>`. 
2. Enhance the licenses.stub.tsv by yourself:
   	- Especially fill the "licenseTemplate" column according to the filenames of the license templates in resources/templates 
   		(APACHE2, BSD, BSD3, CDDL, EPLV1, GPLV2, GPLV3, H2, JSON, LGPLV3, MIT, MPL2, SLICKBSD, UNLICENSE).
   	- Furthermore, fill the column "bundle" and "libraryName" for better readability and "copyRightInformation", 
   		if this information is available.
   	- Add projects which does not use maven manually, if needed. Write "KEEP" at the position of the libraries 
   		of these models (instead of `<currentReleaseVersion>` in the auto generated columns) to avoid 
   		the need of updating these fields manually, when you want to release the next time.
  
3. Create the LICENSE-3RD-PARTY files by
	- `maven-apache-license-util --writeLicense3rdParty <licenses.enhanced.tsv> ALL <currentReleaseVersion> [<targetDir>]` 
	
	This will take only the libraries which have the `<currentReleaseVersion>` (or `KEEP`) at the project columns.
	In addition you can use the optional parameter `<targetDir>`. IF you do so, all direct subfolders of the <targetDir> 
	folder are considered as maven projects and if a project with the same artifactID as in the tsv column headers (projects) 
	is found, the LICENSE-3RD-PARTY file is written into the containing folder. 

##Usage

`maven-apache-license-util <option> [parameters...]`

##Options
```
--updateTsvWithProjectsInFolder <superDirectory> <tsvFile> <currentReleaseVersion>	
	<superDirectory>			The directory containing the project directories.
	<tsvFile>					The analyzed pom information is written to this file. 
								If it exists already, the content is merged.
	<currentReleaseVersion>		This value will be written into the project columns of the tsv 
								if the project uses the library specified by the current row
	
--buildEffectivePom <MavenProjectDirectory>			
		Generates an effective-pom file ("effective-pom.xml") in the current folder.
	<MavenProjectDirectory>		the maven project directory containing the pom file

--addPomToTsv <pomFile> <tsvFile> <currentReleaseVersion>
		Analyzes a maven pom file and generates a table stub, which contains 
		each referenced (as dependency or plugin) library of the project.
		You should use an EFFECTIVE-POM to get all information.
		Dependencies with scope "test" are not considered.							
	<pomFile>					the pom file embedding the 3rd-party libraries 
	<tsvFile>					The analyzed pom information is written to this file. 
								If it exists already, the content is merged.
	<currentReleaseVersion>		will be written into the project columns 
								if the project uses the library specified by the current row

--writeLicense3rdParty <tsvFile> (ALL|<project>) <currentReleaseVersion> [<targetDir>]	
		Use the information of the <tsvFile> and generate LICENSE-3RD-PARTY files 
		via templates from the resources/templates folder.
	<tsvFile>					The enhanced (by you) tsv table stub
	<project>					If you just want to have the LICENSE-3RD-PARTY file 
								of a certain project, use the maven artifactId of this one.
								"ALL" creates the LICENSE-3RD-PARTY files for 
								all projects appearing in the <tsvFile>.
	<currentReleaseVersion>		Only the libraries which have the <currentReleaseVersion> 
								or string "KEEP" in the <project> column are collected. 
								"KEEP" can be used, if you have added a library manually to the list.
	<targetDir>					This folder is searched for maven projects with the same 
								artifactID as in the tsv column headers (projects). 
								If found, the LICENSE-3RD-PARTY file is written into the containing folder. 
								Furthermore, the local repo is updated and the changes in 
								the LICENSE-3RD-PARTY file are committed and pushed for these files, 
								if no special access rights are needed.
--purgeTsv <spreadSheetIN.tsv> <spreadSheetOUT.tsv> <currentReleaseVersion>		
		Deletes all entries, which do not link the library via <currentReleaseVersion> to a project, 
		except entries marked with "KEEP".
	<spreadSheetIN.tsv>			The input tsv file with licensing information
	<spreadSheetOUT.tsv>		The purged output tsv
	<currentReleaseVersion>		The entries, which should stay in the table, 
								should be linked via this version in the project columns.
```
